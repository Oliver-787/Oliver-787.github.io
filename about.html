                <br><br>I was born in Toronto, Ontario then moved to Cape Breton
                Island when I was <br> around 8 years old. I love all things 
                nerdy like video games, <br> D&D, and of course programming. 
                Aside from all that, I am a photographer as a hobby, I play <br> 
                guitar and sing, and I make art every now and again.<br> <br>

                Here, these are some photos I've taken over the years.

                 <br> I am also a guitar player as well as a singer. <br> I
                began playing a few years ago after <br> my father passed away 
                (he was a musician). <br> <br> Here is a small audio clip of me
                playing -->

                Something I haven't spoken <br> about is my pets, I've had <br> 
                many pets over the years so... <br> Here is a list of allllllll 
                the pets I've had <br> <br> <---- <br> <br> Sadly, we currently 
                we don't have any of the fish :/ <br> And yes, we did own a 
                mouse with that name. <br> Me, my brother, and my dad all wanted 
                to name him <br> different names so we went with all 3.
