This is a Personal Website that I made in Dalhousie's CSCI1170 Intro to Web Design class.

This project was the last of three, in which we implemented different web design languages. 
In the first project, we created the website with HTML. 
In the second project,t we added CSS.
Finally, we introduced Javascript to add functionality to the website.

There are a few things to note, however:
1. This hasn't been updated since I created the project. I wanted to leave it untouched to display what I created. I plan on creating a new personal website with updated information.
2. Many features of this project were added to meet the requirements of the assignment, such as nested lists and checkboxes. Again, I'm keeping them to maintain the original project. Some of these aspects may seem silly.

Despite these conditions, I hope you enjoy my first website!
